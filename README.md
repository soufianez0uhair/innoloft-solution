# Innofolt solution

This is my solution for the application. It was such a great challenge for me as I believe my iq has a plus now! That's what I did in 6h, I wanted to structure my react components(User-section, Product-section) and sass(base, components,layout, typo, utilities..) more but I felt like there's no enough time. I used Leaflet for the map! It's my first time dealing with a google maps api but I figured out thankfully :)
Thanks again for the opportunity and hope this proves some potiential in me.
